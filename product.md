#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.

 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.

 We are planning to build a (iOS, Android)? mobile application for the purpose of digitizing physical schedules (posters, handouts, etc.). 
 
 ANSWER: 
 
 It is common to attend events and find that the schedules are either posted up on walls or passed around as handouts or booklets. It is quite a pain to
 have to carry sheets of paper around with you. The solution is obvious: Why not take a picture of the schedule? That leads us directly to the purpose/benefit 
 of this application. 
 
 Taking a photo simply puts the schedule on the phones camera roll, which is only the basic functionality described by the phrase: digitization.
 Several other extensions to this function can be used to add value.
 
 1. Setting alerts for specific sessions within schedule
 2. Send schedules to others?
 3. 
 
#### Q2: Who are your target users?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. )
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.        
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).

 1. University students and professionals who may attend many networking events
 
#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

 1. Convenient
